# Prime-Numbers

A c++ library for dealing with Prime Numbers. Currently uses 9 different functions that are based in the Sieve of Atkin:

-pn_find(n):Finds the highest prime number less or equal to the input given.


-pn_count(n):Counts the amount of primes under a given number(including n).


-pn_den(h):Calculates the density of prime numbers from 1 to h.


-pn_test(a):Primality test for a number, returns a boolean value(1 if prime and 0 if not prime).


-pn_twin(a):Tests if a given number is a twin prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is twin prime and 0 if it is not twin prime).


-pn_cousin(a):Tests if a given number is a cousin prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is a cousin prime and 0 if it is not a cousin prime).


-pn_sexy(a):Tests if a given number is a sexy prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is a sexy prime and 0 if it is not a sexy prime).


-pn_pal(n):Finds the highest palindromic prime equal or less than n.


-n_maxfac(n):Finds the highest prime factor of a given number.
