# Prime-Numbers

**A c++ library for dealing with Prime Numbers. Currently uses 10 different functions that are powered by the Sieve of Atkin:**

- max_prime(n): Finds the highest prime number less or equal to the input given.


- count_primes(n): Counts the amount of primes under a given number(including n).


- prime_density(h): Calculates the density of prime numbers from 1 to h.


- prime_test(p): Primality test for a number, returns a boolean value(1 if prime and 0 if not prime).


- twin_test(p): Tests if a given number is a twin prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is twin prime and 0 if it is not twin prime).


- cousin_test(p): Tests if a given number is a cousin prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is a cousin prime and 0 if it is not a cousin prime).


- sexy_test(p): Tests if a given number is a sexy prime, returns a boolean value(1 if it is a sexy prime and 0 if it is not a sexy prime).


- max_palprime(n): Finds the highest palindromic prime equal or less than n.


- max_factor(f): Finds the highest prime factor of a given number.


- count_factors(f): Counts the number of prime factors that composes a number(including f).
